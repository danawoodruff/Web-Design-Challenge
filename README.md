Visual Studio Code was used for the HTML and bootstrap code.  Individual pages were coded for:<br>
  - Home (index)     https://github.com/danawoodruff/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/main/index.html<br>
  - Comparison of market areas   https://github.com/danawoodruff/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/main/Comparison.html<br>
  - Data             https://github.com/danawoodruff/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/main/Data.html<br>
  - Midtown          https://github.com/danawoodruff/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/main/Midtown.html<br>
  - Heights          https://github.com/danawoodruff/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/main/Heights.html<br>
  - Museum District  https://github.com/danawoodruff/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/main/Museum.html<br>
  - Montrose         https://github.com/danawoodruff/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/main/Montrose.html<br>
<br>
Bootstrap code provided a navigation bar at the top of each page with a dropdown menu to choose a market area to explore.  The user can access each and every page from every other page via the navigation bar. 
<br>
<br>
Each table on the website have a hover capability in that the record activates with a gray background when the cursor hovers over it.  Tables located in the market areas have the record for that market area shaded for ease of comparability.
